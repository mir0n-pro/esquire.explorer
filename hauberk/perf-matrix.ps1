#  Esquire Haubergeon -- PERFORMANCE MATRIX
#
#  Drives super-load across every deployment shape and writes one CSV you can compare.
#
#      k8s     x1  o11y OFF / LOG / FULL
#      k8s     x2  o11y OFF / LOG / FULL
#      docker      OFF / LOG / ON        (SMOKE TEST ONLY -- uncapped, its sag biases an o11y delta; see $CONFIGS)
#
#  o11y has THREE modes (I49): OFF (all logging off, no stack) / LOG (app logging only) / FULL (logging +
#  tracing + metrics). Only pro.mir0n moves between them, so the modes ADD UP. -Runs sets runs per config,
#  -Scale scales the VU count, -Only runs a subset. Each run is FROM SCRATCH, driving several back-to-back loads.
#
#  Entry point: perf-matrix.bat   (launches this detached so a long matrix survives the console)
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY -- every rule below was paid for with a wrong answer.
#
#  FROM SCRATCH, INCLUDING THE DATA.  A run tears the environment down and rebuilds it, and that
#  MUST drop the Postgres + KeyCloak + broker state. k8s-down.bat does NOT delete the PVCs and
#  `docker compose down` does not drop the volume, so a naive down/up silently keeps the old
#  database -- and the audit rows and deleted entities that accumulate there dragged throughput
#  down ~8% per run. With the data wiped, repeat runs agree to ~1-2%; without it, they drifted by
#  13-17% and NO effect smaller than that could be seen at all.
#
#  TWO RUNS PER CONFIG = THE NOISE FLOOR.  The gap between a config's own two from-scratch runs is
#  the smallest difference this rig can honestly resolve. Any config-to-config difference smaller
#  than that is not a finding. (An earlier A/B "showed" a 13% observability cost that turned out
#  to be nothing but run ordering.) Report the noise next to every conclusion.
#
#  DISCARD LOAD 1.  The first load after a rebuild is warm-up -- cold JIT, empty caches, cold
#  pools. It runs 35-45% below steady state, every single time. It is not a baseline and it is not
#  degradation; averaging it in poisons the number. Steady state = loads 2..N.
#
#  ADAPTIVE LOAD COUNT.  4 loads minimum, but keep going while the last load is still CLIMBING
#  more than $ClimbPct on the previous -- a rising last load means the fleet has not finished
#  warming (x2 has twice the JVMs to JIT), and averaging a climb UNDERSTATES the config. Capped at
#  $MaxLoads; hitting the cap while still climbing is logged loudly, because it means steady state
#  was never reached and the number is not trustworthy.
#
#  OFF MEANS OFF.  k8s-up.bat installs the observability viewing stack as part of a normal bring-up,
#  so "o11y OFF" is NOT off unless o11y-off.bat uninstalls it. Leave it running and the ON-vs-OFF
#  delta prices only the in-process half of the bill. (On k8s the collectors alone cost ~8%.)
#
#  STRICTLY SEQUENTIAL -- ONE STACK AT A TIME.  The only parallelism permitted in the whole matrix
#  is Gatling's virtual users. Running docker and k8s together on one machine is what invalidated
#  an entire first day of measurements: docker looked 5x slower purely because the cluster was
#  sharing the box.
#
#  RESUMABLE.  Results are appended after EVERY load, and a run already present in the CSV is
#  skipped. A matrix takes hours; an interruption at run 11 must not cost runs 1-10.

# The matrix. Order groups k8s first so docker only needs the cluster torn down once.
# THREE ARMS since I49 (mir0n):
#
#   OFF  app logger OFF (levelMir0n=OFF), no viewing stack, no tracing/metrics   <- the baseline
#   LOG  app logger INFO + loki/alloy/grafana ONLY, tracing/metrics off          <- the log pillar alone
#   ON   everything (tracing + metrics + shipping)
#
# THE KNOB IS levelMir0n, NEVER levelRoot (mir0n). `pro.mir0n` carries its own level in logback-spring.xml and
# no appender of its own, so its events reach the root's ECS CONSOLE appender by ADDITIVITY -- an ancestor's
# LEVEL is never re-checked on the way. levelRoot therefore gates only third-party libraries and CANNOT silence
# the application. THE 07-16 RUN TURNED ROOT AND IS VOID: the app logged identically in both arms, cancelled out
# of the delta, and the resulting "-4.7%" was the price of third-party libs plus loki/alloy/grafana -- not of
# logging. Those load runs must be REDONE with this knob.
#
# T10 (doc/review/Esquire.PerfMatrix-07-14.md) is SOUND and is NOT superseded: the app logged at DEBUG in both
# its arms, and its ON arm really did ship those lines to Loki while its OFF arm uninstalled Alloy/Loki. So its
# -11.5% / -24% IS the full o11y cost, all three pillars. What T10 lacks is only the per-pillar SPLIT -- which
# is the whole of I49's job.
# devLog/msgLog (DEBUG/INFO, to FILES) are IDENTICAL in every arm and cancel out by design -- the only thing that
# moves between OFF and LOG is the logging o11y stack.
# DOCKER IS NOT AN INSTRUMENT FOR o11y COST -- it is a smoke test (mir0n, 2026-07-17). Do not re-add it to an
# o11y measurement, and do not "fix" it with a lower load. See doc/review/Esquire.PerfMatrix-07-14.md Part III.
#   k8s plateaus DEAD FLAT (573,1045,1034,1046 = 0.0% drift) because every pod is capped at 1 CPU: it draws
#   ~1045 rps and leaves the box headroom. docker is UNCAPPED -- it takes all 24 cores, saturates the host
#   (services + infra + o11y stack + Gatling in one 16 GB WSL2 VM) and Windows throttles, so it SAGS.
#   THE SAG SCALES WITH THROUGHPUT: the all-logs-off arm was the fastest ever measured here (2243 rps) and
#   sagged the HARDEST (-44%); slower arms sag ~11%. Throughput IS what an o11y comparison measures, so the
#   decline eats the delta, always in the same direction. That is a BIAS. Two runs do not cancel it; averaging
#   does not cancel it.
#   AND the 200-VU super-load runs docker PAST ITS KNEE: 100 VUs gives the SAME 2225 rps at HALF the p99
#   (235 vs 533 ms). The extra users buy queueing, not work. Nothing measured past the knee is a measurement.
#   OKE caps app services at ~750m on ~1-OCPU nodes = the same effective 1 CPU local k8s reproduces. docker,
#   the only place a JVM sees 24 cores, resembles nothing we deploy. k8s "slower" than docker is that budget.
# THE THREE MODES (mir0n, 2026-07-17) = OFF / LOG / FULL. They ADD UP because only ONE thing ever moves --
# pro.mir0n -- while develop/msg/amq/jms are OFF and root sits at its ERROR default in EVERY arm:
#   OFF -> LOG   the log pillar alone        LOG -> FULL  tracing + metrics alone
#   OFF -> FULL  the whole observability bill
# "ON" is a FOURTH, different thing: the stack AS SHIPPED, pro.mir0n at its DEBUG chart default. It is what
# T10 measured (12%/24%, sound). Keep it to reproduce T10 -- never mix it into the three-mode arithmetic.
