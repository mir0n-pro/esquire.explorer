/**
 * Standalone teardown: resolves the hauberk-office-smoke office via
 * biztree, then walks its natural-tree subtree and best-effort deletes
 * everything.
 *
 * Use cases:
 *   - Before a fresh sprint test session, to clear leftover residue from
 *     prior failed runs.
 *   - After a biztree restart, when the cache has been refreshed against
 *     DB state and lookup-by-name finally points at a real entity again.
 *
 * Re-run as needed: each pass cleans one matching office (the one
 * biztree's /esq-enode returns first); if multiple matches exist in DB,
 * run the Simulation repeatedly until no more residue remains.
