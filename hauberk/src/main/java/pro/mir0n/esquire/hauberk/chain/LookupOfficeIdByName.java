/**
 * GET /esq-enode?kind=20&name=#{officeName}. Resolves an office name to its
 * id via the biztree node lookup -- a cheap O(1) cache hit, in contrast to
 * a whole-subtree fetch from authoritative source.
 *
 * Cache trade-off accepted: biztree may occasionally hold a stale id for
 * an office that no longer exists in esq_org. That is fine for the cleanup
 * use case -- the v1.2.4 goal is "remove ALL test data from DB", and a
 * stale id passed into /esq-cmd-tree returns an empty subtree (which is
 * the correct cleanup answer: nothing in DB to remove). Biztree cache
 * invalidation is a separate concern, out of scope here.
 *
 * Session inputs:
 *   officeName -- the office name to look up.
 *
 * Session outputs:
 *   officeId   -- set on 200; not set on 404 (caller checks .contains()
 *                 to distinguish "found" from "missing").
 *
 * Status filtering: both 200 and 404 are acceptable here; the chain does
 * not fail on a missing office. Callers branch on whether officeId was set.
