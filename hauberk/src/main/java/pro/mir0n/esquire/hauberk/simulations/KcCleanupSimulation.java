 * 06/01/2026 mir0n  created: KC-side orphan cleanup -- master-realm admin auth + DELETE every
 *                   hauberk-* user in the esquire realm. Runs against the KC admin REST API
 *                   directly (not the gateway), so it is independent of TokenRelay mode.

/**
 * Standalone teardown for the KC side of the hauberk playground.
 *
 * After a race-8c run (RaceMoveCreateKc), KC may be left with hauberk-* users
 * whose DB counterparts have been deleted by the standard CleanHouse run. The
 * /esq-cmd-del DELETE flow does best-effort KC removal via kcMaster, but the
 * race-8c silent-skip means kcMaster may have missed the original CREATE URQ
 * for a user, leaving an orphan with no DB row to delete-from.
 *
 * This sim authenticates with the KC master-realm bootstrap admin
 * (hauberk.properties: kc.admin.user / kc.admin.password) and walks the
 * esquire realm /admin/realms/esquire/users?search=hauberk- list, DELETE-ing
 * each. Safe to run idempotently -- 404s on already-deleted users are
 * accepted (other VUs / prior runs may have removed them).
 *
 * Run pattern:
 *   hauberk.cmd CleanHouse        (DB-side teardown -- removes esq_user rows)
 *   hauberk.cmd KcCleanup         (this sim -- removes KC users left behind)
 *
 * Run order matters only in one direction: KcCleanup AFTER CleanHouse, so
 * the standard /esq-cmd-del path has already had its chance to remove KC
 * users via kcMaster. Anything left is by definition an orphan.
